Temporary bookmark-like app.

The idea is that sometimes you want to save a link or a bit of text for later, 
but using bookmarks eventually gets messy, and it's kind of a pain to manage 
them constantly to clean them up. This aims to fix that annoyance.
Paste a link into the page and it saves it, I'm toying with a 3 day saved time.
Links to bookmark the url, copy to clipboard or remove it. 
clicking the url takes you there as normal.

Hoping to eventually automatically read the clipboard from the open tab/create 
a browser addon to do this. But I've never made one of those, so I don't have 
any idea how to do this yet. Yes, it's pretty key, but jumping in head first 
seems like a good move at this point.  

Lets do this!
