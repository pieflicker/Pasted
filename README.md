Temporary bookmark-like app.

Soooo looks like most browsers block access to the clipboard, presumably as a
safety feature (stealing passwords and such). 
This puts a real damper on the idea, as it's pretty reliant on that functionality. 
Are addons under the same restrictions? I know things like jdownloader scrape the 
clipboard to find links you may want to download, but an external application is
beyond the scope of my current capabilities. Oh well, next project I guess.



The idea is that sometimes you want to save a link or a bit of text for later, 
but using bookmarks eventually gets messy, and it's kind of a pain to manage 
them constantly to clean them up. This aims to fix that annoyance.
Paste a link into the page and it saves it, I'm toying with a 3 day saved time.
Links to bookmark the url, copy to clipboard or remove it. 
clicking the url takes you there as normal.

Hoping to eventually automatically read the clipboard from the open tab/create 
a browser addon to do this. But I've never made one of those, so I don't have 
any idea how to do this yet. Yes, it's pretty key, but jumping in head first 
seems like a good move at this point.  

Lets do this!
